### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
The world is changing and itâ€™s changing fast, new innovations arrive every day, one better than the other, new technologies making older ones obsolete in a matter of days and in this changing world an individual is nothing by himself. Only by becoming a part of a larger organization can an individual thrive in this world. Being a part of something greater than oneself is something I consider to be noble. I want to be an inventor and innovator in the field of engineering by working in collaboration with others.
